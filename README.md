# üéÆ Quarto Board Game ‚Äì Capstone Project

This project is my final-year capstone at the American University of Armenia. I developed a fully playable 3D version of the board game **Quarto** using Unity, integrated several AI agents for decision-making, and conducted performance analysis using data-driven methods.

## üß† Project Highlights

- Developed a 3D board game in **Unity (C#)**
- Implemented core game mechanics, rules, and win-check conditions
- Created and integrated multiple AI agents:
  - **Minimax**
  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
  - **Game Theory‚Äìbased heuristic**
- Used **transposition tables** to optimize search efficiency
- Ran hundreds of simulations and performance tests
- Visualized and compared AI performance across game stages
- Full report with analysis and architecture included

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Unity (C#)
- Java (initial logic prototype)
- Google Sheets / Excel (data analysis)
- Custom-built AI evaluation and decision logic

## üìÑ Capstone Report

The full project report is available here:  
üìò [Capstone_Report_Quarto_Zara_Karapetyan.pdf](./Capstone_Report_Quarto_Zara_Karapetyan.pdf)

It includes:
- Architecture and class structure
- AI agent logic and design
- Experimental setup and data
- Visual results and performance analysis

## üöÄ How to Run the Game
